# Nunam-Technoogies-Assignment

This project is a Streamlit application that visualizes battery metrics for two cell IDs (5308 and 5329) using Plotly charts. The application reads data from xls files, creates pie charts for the state of health of the batteries, and displays line plots for various metrics over time.

## Features

- **Battery State of Health (SOH)**: Pie charts showing the health status of cells 5308 and 5329.
- **Metrics Visualization for CELL ID 5308**:
  - Voltage vs Time
  - Current vs Time
  - Temperature vs Time
  - Capacity vs Time
- **Metrics Visualization for CELL ID 5329**:
  - Voltage vs Time
  - Current vs Time
  - Temperature vs Time
  - Capacity vs Time

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Streamlit
- Plotly
